# InvoiceAuditCrew - CrewAI Crew

## üöÄ Overview

InvoiceAuditCrew automates the extraction, categorization, and validation of data from uploaded invoices. It uses a team of AI agents to convert scanned or digital invoices into structured accounting-ready files, while also performing light auditing to detect duplicates, validate tax, and flag policy violations.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **PDF Table Extractor (with OCR)**: Automatically extracts tabular data and metadata from scanned or digital invoice files using OCR and parsing logic.
- **Vendor & Currency Parser**: Identifies vendor names, invoice numbers, dates, and currencies, supporting multi-currency environments.
- **Line Item Categorizer**: Assigns appropriate accounting categories (e.g., Office Supplies, Software, Meals) to each invoice line item using AI-based classification.
- **Invoice Validator**: Performs auditing checks such as tax calculation verification, subtotal/total consistency, and date validation.
- **Duplicate Detector**: Flags potentially duplicated invoices based on fuzzy matching of invoice number, vendor, and amount.
- **Policy Compliance Auditor**: Cross-checks line items against a predefined set of company expense policies and flags violations.
